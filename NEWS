Versions of package "RadialPlotter"
Version 2.2
        * Add one new function "fastED()", which is used to approximate the fast-component equivalent dose.
          Now function "decomp()" is able to decompose a signal table (a series of decay curves from a single aliquot) simultaneously.
Version 2.1
        * Function "decomp()" now allows some transformations between different fitting models; optional argument "xylim" in function "decomp()"
          has been removed.
Version 2.0
        * Plot output by function "decomp()" and "RadialPlotter()" have been modified to be more dynamically by adding some plus options; 
          Function "calED()" and "sgcED()" now allow forcing the fitting to pass the origin optionally.
Version 1.9
        * Parameters used for fitting a dose-response curve in function "calED()" and "sgcED()" now can be initialized automatically,
          function "decomp()" is able to decompose OSL decay curve of type "LM" in this version. And "port" algorithm
          is bundled to function "RadialPlotter()" for optimizing minimum age models. Now results of function
          "RadialPlotter()" is an object of class "RadialPlotter". 
Version 1.8
        * Add a new function "calED()", some bugs in function "sgcED()" have been corrected.
Version 1.7
        * Function "decomp()" and function "sgcED()" have been added to package "RadialPlotter" in this version. 
Version 1.6
        * Possible complier dependent errors are removed.
Version 1.5
        * Both MAM3 (minimum age model with three parameters) and MAM4 (minimum age model with four parameters) are bundled 
          to this version. See the PDF manual for more information.
Version 1.0
        * OSL statistical age models analysis for CAM (central age model) and FMM (finite mixture age model) are available, 
          a radial plot can also be drawn using this primitive version. See the PDF manual for more information.
